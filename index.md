### Personal Information
My name is Dean Heighway and I'm a 27-year-old born in Australia and of Australian decent, in my lifetime I’ve only ever spoken English and I’ve learned beginner levels or Italian. My highest level of education is finishing the HSC and also, I have completed a semester of a bachelor of nutrition. 

I love all sports but have a keen interest in cricket, currently my season has just finished last week as my team lost in the semifinals however, I am enjoying watching the current tour of Australia to Pakistan. 

### Interest in IT
My interest in IT stems from a long history of video games and love of computers, ever since I was four years old, I remember playing Warcraft 2 and StarCraft with my dad in his spare time and from then I was hooked in gaming. Over time my love of gaming developed into wanting a further understanding of the ins and outs of computers and the how and why of games; what powers them? How are they built? 

I have very limited IT experience at the moment but its quickly growing throughout the duration of this course. 

I choose RMIT for my studies as it is one of the leading IT programs in the country and it also offers the convenience of online study, being someone who full time works I can’t attend standard university so I opt for the convenience of online.  

I expect to obtain a greater understanding of how computers work both internally and externally as well as a deeper understanding and competency of programming languages. 

### Ideal Job

https://careers.blizzard.com/global/en/job/R007754/Mid-Senior-Encounter-Designer-World-of-Warcraft 
This job is responsible for the high quality encounter design of raid and dungeon content within the game world of warcraft; including things such as creative design, technical implementation, and careful attention to details such as balance and polish.  A requirement for this job is a minimum of 3 years of game development experience and two years of content creation. 

This job is appealing for me as for a long time during my life I have played this game at a very high level and have a deep connection to the game, I always used to think of ideas to myself of what I could do in a role like this to challenge myself as someone who plays the game in new and unique ways. 

 

At the moment I am a long way off this goal but I believe in time with a lot of hard work I can get towards this goal, I just need a deeper understanding of game development and programming which is something that I am hoping I can develop in my time in this degree. 

 

To get to this point I am going to try and master python as a coding language so that I can get to the point of being able to code in for games and also continue to play games to keep the imagination alive and fresh as well as the passion for gaming as I believe that is crucial for a role like that. 

 ### Personal Profile
 I completed the online test for MBPT and got the result of INFP this means that I am introverted with an intuitive type of energy with a feeling nature. The tactics that I use are prospecting and the identity is turbulent. 

I then completed a learning style quiz with a very split set of results: Auditory learning was 30%, visual learning was 35% and tactile 35%. From this result I learned that things that would help me the most would be visualizing that I hear, writing down key words ideas or instructions and importantly avoiding distractions during my study time. 

For the tactile side it suggests hands on learning and taking short sharp bursts of study periods as well as using a computer to reinforce learning through the sense of touch. 

Lastly, I did a big five personality test at truity.com and it measured my personality to be OCEAN: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. 

From these tests I can deduce that I am an empathetic individual who works well as a team and doesn’t cause problems or have personality clashes. Within a team environment I believe that this makes me a great asset as I would stay on focus and be able to contribute to the project through my own ideas and contributions as well as being able to bring the best out of others. I think when forming a team to mix with my abilities it would be great to get someone who is very structured with their approach, someone who is a bit more extraverted and more direct with their ideas and the direction they want to take things, I believe that opposites work well together and that is why a person with those attributes would be great alongside me so that we can cover all the bases for a great team. 

### Project Idea
I want to design an app, the purpose of the app would be to get information from the user in regards to what food they have in the kitchen, they would enter it into the app and then the app would compile a list of recipes that they can make with the food that they have available, the name is a work in progress but along the lines of ‘What can I make with this?’. It would most likely be a smartphone app with compatibility for things like google home and Alexa. 

The motivation behind this idea is that there are numerous times where I’m thinking about what I should make for dinner or what I should cook for lunch but I have a restriction of what food is in the house or what particular taste I feel like, for example if I feel like something with tomatoes but I’m not sure what I could just put tomatoes into the app and a protein source and then it would spit out a list of meals to make. 

The app will have a few features, to start off it will be separate the database of meals based off what meal you want to prepare; for example, breakfast will include things like smoothies but not for dinner. You could put in as few or as many ingredients as you want for the meal and it will come up with a result so long as the database has a match with the ingredients stored in it. 

I would ideally like to create a feature for that app that lets you favorite and save meals, and even compile an inventory on what you have in the house. With the inventory feature when you select a meal that you are cooking it would remove the ingredients from your inventory and then it will add it to a shopping list feature. 

The shopping list feature could be linked to Woolworths or Coles online shopping or even just a standard list itself that you can take to the shops but in an ideal world would have the capability to once you are ready to send an order for the shopping list it can add to cart all the ingredients that you need so that you don’t need to think about it. Expanding on the shopping list section with your favorited meals it would give the option to give notifications if you are out of an ingredient for example chicken and you have chicken soup favorited it will give you a notification that you have no chicken with the option to press a button to add chicken to the list/cart. 

I could add a commercial version of that app for restaurants if it were successful enough liaising with providers to the restaurant to ping notifications to suppliers to let them know that restaurant needs more of a certain item, kind of like a smart ordering system. This would also double as a way for restaurants to manage an increased supply and demand of ingredients or also a decrease in demand.  

Also, a great feature that I would add is an expiration timer on perishables such as fruit and vegetables, when you clear a shopping list it will add a 5–7-day window or a customizable amount of time depending on user preference in order to keep the user up to date with fresh fruit and vegetables and to ensure that meat doesn’t spoil also resulting in less waste. 

A final feature that could be included is nutritional information, a great feature that could be added to this app is a nutritional calculator adding together all the macronutrients of the ingredients in the recipe to provide sufficient macronutrients with the option to substitute for healthier options and also an ability to add your own recipes to the database for you own take on a meal for example ‘protein pizza’. 

The tools required for this app would be a programming tool such as python to receive input from the user and relay the information into the system and react to things such as adding to a shopping list and nutritional information calculator, as well as a database to program to store the required information for the recipes and macronutrients on products. 

The skills required would be a proficiency in python and a knowledge of how to store databases, the workload would be huge unless you can get a way to import pre-existing databases from other apps as well as the knowledge in a database app such as postgreSQL. 

The outcome of this app would be a solution to the many people just like me who have no idea what they want to cook for dinner and also it would have the added convenience of things such as a macronutrient calculator for those who are health conscious as well as a commercial version for restaurants to manage inventory. It will make life a lot easier for those who struggle for inspiration and a smarter way for restaurants to manage inventory.
